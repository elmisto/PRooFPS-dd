## Summary

This game is the successor of the [original PR00FPS made in 2007](https://github.com/proof88/PR00FPS).  
It uses my open-source [game engine](https://github.com/proof88/PGE).

This game is still **under development**.

## Try the Game

The latest available download version [v0.1.6.1 Private Beta is here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ruZMjLmeU571It93LEwDnRKt72csj2tv/view?usp=drive_link).  
If the game cannot start due to missing DLL files, [this Visual C++ Redistributable Package](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B61VzifHvK-wTNGUai4HaEeik2cXLRHH/view?usp=share_link) should be installed.

[Version history is here.](HISTORY.md)

### Run as Server

To start as server, simply run `PRooFPS-dd.exe`.

### Run as Client

To start as client, simply run the convenient:
 - `PRooFPS-dd-as-client.bat` (Windows) or
 - `PRooFPS-dd-as-client.sh` (Linux).

To specify IP-address of the server for the client, change `cl_server_ip` CVAR in `gamedata/profiles/default/default.cfg`.  

Alternatively, you can use command line arguments as well, e.g.:  
`./PRooFPS-dd.exe --net_server=false --cl_server_ip=192.168.1.100`

### Keyboard, Mouse

 - **A/D, LEFT/RIGHT:** move the player (strafe);
 - **LSHIFT:** toggle move speed: walking or running;
 - **SPACE:** jump;
 - **LCTRL:** crouch/duck;
 - **R**: reload current weapon;
 - **2,3 / Mouse Wheel**: change to pistol or machine gun;
 - **Mouse Click**: attack (fire weapon);
 - **TAB:** show frag table;
 - **M:** switch to next map based on mapcycle.txt;
 - **BACKSPACE:** show GUI demo;
 - **ENTER/RETURN:** if `testing=true` CVAR is defined, it makes a dump of testing data into `RegTestDumpServer.txt` or `RegTestDumpClient.txt`;
 - **T**: if instance is server, it respawns the player to a random spawnpoint and dumps debug data to console window.

### Debugging

If you have any problem with the game, it is always recommended to save the latest generated log file(s) from the game's main directory.  
Their file name format is: `log_<hostname>_<date>_<time>.html` .  
Since they are saved in HTML format, it is easy to open and read them in your favourite web browser, but what is better is if you send them to the developer.

If you have performance issues and you are running the server instance of the game, pressing 'T' key anytime during the game saves extra information into the HTML log file.  

If you have network related issue, you can check real-time network statistics by displaying the frag table by pressing the 'TAB' key.  
Note that some network statistics are also saved into the HTML log file whenever a client- or server instance disconnects.

## Build

You must have the Visual Studio solution file including other relevant projects as well in [PGE-misc](https://github.com/proof88/PGE-misc) repo.  
**Follow the build instructions** in [PGE-WoW.txt](https://github.com/proof88/PGE-misc/blob/master/src/PGE-WoW.txt).  
As described in that file, you need to build other projects before PRooFPS-dd can be built.
