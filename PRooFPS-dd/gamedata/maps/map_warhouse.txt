# Textures for each map block/element
# Not defining texture for a specific block does not cause error,
# but the block will be automatically assigned a dummy red texture.

# Foreground blocks are at the same depth as the players,

# BDFGHIJ

# 'S' char represents spawn/start point. Multiple 'S' chars can be placed.
# Number of spawn points defines the max allowed players on the map.
# A spawn point is basically a background block to which texture can be
# assigned the same way as to other blocks.

# 'P' char represents pistol.
# 'M' char represents machine gun.
# '+' char represents health/medkit.

# If not '=' char and not ignored line, it is treated as
# layout definition. 
# Map layout consists of lines of chars not containing either '#' or
# '=' chars. The map layout contains the blocks a.k.a. the elements
# of the map in multiple lines.
# Space chars represent empty block.
