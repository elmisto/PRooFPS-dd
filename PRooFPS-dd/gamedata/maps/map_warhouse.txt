# Foreground blocks are at the same depth as the players,
# meaning they can be used as either floor or wall, since
# the players will collide with them.

# The following chars are used for defining foreground blocks:
# BDFGHIJ
# Remaining chars to be used as foreground blocks: KLQT

# Background blocks are 1 depth away from the players towards
# the background, they can be used as background walls.

# The following chars are used for defining background blocks:
# acenorv
# Remaining chars to be used as background blocks: suwxyz

# Textures for each map block/element
# Not defining texture for a specific block does not cause error,
# but the block will be automatically assigned a dummy red texture.

# 'S' char represents spawn/start point. Multiple 'S' chars can be placed.

# Map layout consists of lines of chars not containing either '#' or
# '=' chars. The map layout contains the blocks a.k.a. the elements
# of the map in multiple lines.
# Space chars represent empty block.
