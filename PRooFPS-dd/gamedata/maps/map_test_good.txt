# If no '=' char and not ignored line, it is treated as
# layout definition. 

# Foreground blocks are at the same depth as the players,
# meaning they can be used as either floor or wall, since
# the players will collide with them.

# The following chars are used for defining foreground blocks:
# ABCDEFG

# Background blocks are 1 depth away from the players towards
# the background, they can be used as background walls.

# The following chars are used for defining background blocks:
# HIJKLMN

# Space chars represent empty block.

# Map layout consists of lines of chars not containing either '#' or
# '=' chars. The map layout contains the blocks a.k.a. the elements
# of the map in multiple lines.
