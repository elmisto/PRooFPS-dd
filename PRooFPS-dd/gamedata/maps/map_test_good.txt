# Lines starting with hashtag are comments and ignored by loader

# Blank lines are also ignored by loader

# Variable name are case-sensitive!

# Name of the map is that will be displayed in map select submenu
Name = Test Map

Gravity = 2.0

# Preview Image is not needed to be explicitly defined here, as
# image file with same name is to be used implicitly as preview.

# Textures for each map block/element
# Not defining texture for a specific block does not cause error,
# but the block will be automatically assigned a dummy red texture.
# Textures should be placed in a separate directory specific to this map,
# within gamedata/textures directory. The specific directory name should be
# the same as the map file name without the extension part.
# In this case the directory is: gamedata/textures/map_test_good/

# Foreground blocks are at the same depth as the players,
# meaning they can be used as either floor or wall, since
# the players will collide with them.
# The following chars are used for defining foreground blocks:
# BDFGHIJ
# Remaining chars to be used as foreground blocks: KLQT

#B = floor.bmp # intentionally commented to test if B blocks really assigned red texture
D = floor.bmp
F = floor.bmp
G = floor.bmp
H = floor.bmp
I = floor.bmp
J = crate.bmp

# Background blocks are 1 depth away from the players towards
# the background, they can be used as background walls.
# The following chars are used for defining background blocks:
# acnor
# Remaining chars to be used as background blocks: esuvwxyz

a = brick1.bmp
c = brick2.bmp
n = aztec01.bmp
o = brick1.bmp
r = brick1.bmp

# Pickupable items:
# 'P' char represents pistol.
# 'M' char represents machine gun.
# '+' char represents health/medkit.
# Since these items are in the foreground, a background block might be implicitly
# created behind them, if there is a previously created NEIGHBOR background block
# next to them. In such case, that previous background block's texture will be
# applied, otherwise NO background block will be created behind the item.

# 'S' char represents spawn/start point. Multiple 'S' chars can be placed on the map.
# Number of spawn points might define the max allowed players on the map in the future but
# now players don't collide, so it is not yet a hard limit.
# A spawn point is similar to pickupable items but it is not visible.
# Background block might be implicitly created with the same rule as with pickupable items.

# If not '=' char and not ignored line, it is treated as
# layout definition. 
# Map layout consists of lines of chars not containing either '#' or
# '=' chars. The map layout contains the blocks a.k.a. the elements
# of the map in multiple lines.
# Space chars represent empty block.
# Since all lines are trimmed before being processed, starting layout definition with whitespaces
# are strictly not recommended.
